## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with the deployment:

1. Check the build logs in the Vercel dashboard for specific errors

   - Missing dependencies
   - TypeScript errors
   - Next.js configuration issues

## Sharing Your Project

Once deployed, you can share the Vercel URL with others to let them play the game. The game is fully static and doesn't require any backend services.

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a static export in the `out` directory that you can serve with any static file server.
